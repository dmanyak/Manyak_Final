        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            I am a designer focusing on product design, logos, and image composites. Currently, I am pursuing my associate's in Graphic Design and Marketing at Wake Technical Community College. My favorite type of design work involves highly editing images when an image is the center of a design solution that is where my work stands out.

        <h3>Enchanted Nook</h3>
        <p>
            I was set on keeping the manipulation as close to the original idea as possible which created a lot of room for problem solving. Puppet Warp, Custom patterns, Bevel & Emboss, and Creating Custom Brushes were all new things I had to learn for this project to be successful.

            <h3>PROXIMA</h3>
            <p>
                In the year 2419, Earth faces an unprecedented crisis, brought about by the relentless "HOLO" virus, which has pushed Earth to the brink of collapse. This virus, unlike any other, is marked by its rapid mutations, leaving humanity desperately searching for a cure. Predictions from scientists paint a grim picture: Earth will no longer be habitable within the next century.

            <h3>WINTER SNOW</h3>
            <p>
                This was a final class project with a goal to test my Photoshop skill level. Requirements were as follows: use a minimum of five photos, have a minimum of three text hierarchies, and include the volume and date of the magazine.

        <h3>Blue Moon</h3>
        <p>
            This was one of my first successful logos. I created a total of 50 sketches before settling for this logo idea. New tools like outline stroke were discovered during this illustrator project.

            <p>
                This is a logo and merch design for Wake Techs Philosophy Club. I wanted to create something simple but with a lot of meaning. The message behind the logo is “Discover new Ideas”.

            <h3>Think Big</h3>
            <p>
                For this project, I created a full brand identity for the “Think Big Conference”. Deliverables included a logo, brand guide, merchandise, social media pieces, lanyard, conference banners, and, photo backdrops.

    <div class="layout1type">
        <h3>Gym Bro Recipies</h3>
        <p>
            My goal for this project was to let the typographic hierarchy and grid layout lead the design. Bold fonts and neutral colors were used throughout the design to give it a rough feel. Carbs, fats, and proteins were given a highlighted section because they are essential parts of a diet when it comes to building muscle. During the ideation phase, my main focus was minimal and clean which I believe was achieved.

            <h3>Sawdust & Clay</h3>
            <p>
                Sawdust & Clay is a client with whom I had the pleasure of working with. It was a group project I was assigned to design a brochure deliverable that would be used during marketing events. My goal for this brochure was to stick with a calm, minimal, but also playful theme. Rather than going for a traditional bordered-off design I wanted to make each panel flow into the next.

            <h3>Cerine Spa</h3>
            <p>
                For this project, I created a full brand identity for a fictional spa and wellness company called Cerine. The client's goal was for the spa to convey luxury but also show that everyone is welcome. The calm tones used throughout are welcoming and the gold accents express luxury.
